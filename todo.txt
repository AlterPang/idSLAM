Now basic multi-kinect SLAM with back-end closing loops from one camera is initially done. Next modification to do:

0. External calibration of cameras without tracking system !!!! WTF

1. modify the median-based robust standard-deviation, so that image and depth measurements can be weighted seperately.

2. solve the synchronisation problem among multiple kinects.


OTHERS: it's possible I didn't use the yaml parsing correct camera calibration file. 
	need to check this in the backend.
