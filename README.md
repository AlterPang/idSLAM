idSLAM (InDoorSLAM)
======

A SLAM system using multiple Kinects for indoor applications. It extends the PTAM system (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gk/PTAM/) as described in [4] 
to be able to integrate measurements from multiple Kinects. Furthermore, an efficient back-end for loop closing is implemented 
to form a full SLAM system. More robust performance is achieved using our multi-kinect setup, compared with conventional RGBD-SLAM systems.

This work is based on the previous work described in [1, 2, 3].
